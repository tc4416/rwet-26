The tips\\nOf his fingers, still idly tickling, list\\nTo some flesh-response to their purple mood.\\nBut their love-orison is not understood.\\nThe god is dead whose cult was to be kissed!\\n\\nHe lifts his hand up to where heaven should be\\nAnd cries on the mute gods to know his pain.\\nLo, list!, o divine watchers of our glee\\nAnd sorrow!, list!, he will yield up his reign.\\nHe will live in the deserts and be parched\\nOn the hot sands, he will be beggar and slave;\\nBut give again the boy to be arm-reached!\\nForego that space ye meant to be his grave!\\n\\nTake all the female beauties of the earth!\\nTake all afar and rend them if ye will!\\nBut, by sweet Ganymede, that Jove found worth\\nAnd above Hebe did elect to fill\\nHis cup at his high festivals, and spill\\nHis fairer vice wherefrom comes newer birth--,\\nThe clod of female embraces resolve\\nTo dust, o father of the gods!, but spare\\nThis boy and his white body and golden hair.\\nMaybe thy newer Ganymede thou mÂŽeanst\\nThat he should be, and out of jealous care\\nFrom Hadrian's arms to thine his beauty steal'st.\""
