    "# Background\n",
    "I was thinking about what theme I want to use for this assignment when I walk to school (I live just a few block a way on Albee Sqr in downtown area ), and I noticed that my thoughts are jumping from one topic to another very quickly, along with interuption caused by everything happening on the street, the stores I pass by, the loud noise etc.. So I think maybe I could create a generative poem they represent this chaotic/anxious 7 minutes walk I have everyday on my way to school.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is fairly simple and is based on \"A House of Dust\" poetry generator by Alison Knowles and James Tenney. \"A House of Dust\" seperate the swappable words/sentences into 4 categaries : materials, locations, light, \"inhabitant\", and I am using the same technique here. What is different is that I put phrase that will use multiple times into funtions so that they're easier to be reused. I chose the words purely based on whatever comes into my mind."
